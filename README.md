# Smart React.js Bulma forms

This is a lightweight Bulma React.js smart component library, built on Bulma 1.0+. Supports ES6 tree shaking, moduler, performant. Includes validators, internationalization automation, automated forms, automated layouts.

Compatible with Vite, Webpack, etc.

### Currently not supported Bulma components:
- [Panels](https://bulma.io/documentation/components/panel/), due to being over engineered if wrapped
- [Menus](https://bulma.io/documentation/components/menu/), due to being too simple
